# Progress

The one record of where the work stands. Every session updates it as it works; the coordinator keeps the session list true. "Done" means merged to main and green there.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-13-ruken-reels-linktree-design.md`, approved by the Owner on 2026-11-13.
Launch: Monday 30 November 2026, 11:00 CT.

## Slice 0: Start

- [x] The design and the workflow committed as the first commit (`1fbe65a`).
- [x] The Owner approved the design, 2026-11-13, with Netlify, Neon and Cloudflare; payouts code after launch, before 10 December; FloorFifty as the one launch game.
- [x] AGENTS.md, from design section 3.
- [x] This tracker.
- [x] The app skeleton: one SvelteKit app at the old repository's pinned versions (Node 24.22.1, pnpm 10.34.6, SvelteKit 3.0.0, Svelte 5.57.1, Vite 8.3.3, TypeScript 6.0.3, Vitest 5.0.3, Playwright 1.63.0), a placeholder home page, and `tests/architecture.test.ts` for the layer rule.
- [x] The CI workflow: `verify` (lint, typecheck, unit tests, build) and `browser` (Playwright, phone and computer), on GitHub's runners.
- [x] The layer test seen failing in CI for the right reason (run 43484877992 on `e81db50`: "src/stray.test.ts" in src/, and "accounts may only import features below it"; lint, typecheck and the browser job passed).
- [ ] The layer test passing in CI once the break is removed.
- [ ] Merged to main, green there.

Notes for later slices:

- Prisma, Postgres and a Postgres job in CI arrive with slice 1, when the first table does. Adding that job changes `ci.yml`, which needs the Owner's words quoted in the commit; design 7.4 is those words.
- `src/index.ts` from CLAUDE.md's structure is not made: an app has no public surface for others to import. Routes in `src/routes/` reach features through their entry files.
- Testing Library and jsdom arrive with the first component test.
